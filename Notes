TODO
	Serious:
  	+ en passante
			- Have to get a pgn with en passante
		+ JS should be more relaxed when it comes to
			the pgn format (wp tinyMCE editor adds extra tags (br, p) that
			i strip with php's strip_tags and the output differs on how
			tinyMCE acted upon pasting the content. FF & Opera are cool,
			Konq is going crazy at the moment.

	Normal:
		+ Read the PGN spec
			+ think what to do with comments
			+ variations
		+ get new images from Riivo - EMAIL SENT
		+ test the page with IE 6, 7
			+ when i alert the innerHTML of the div I get the contents it should have
				but nothing is displayed :(
			+ mnz, helmer, martti, johh can be testers
	
	Any:
		+ write about starting devel with wordpress
		+ Make development page (wiki) at pgnview.com
