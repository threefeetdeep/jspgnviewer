TODO
	ver-0.2 - 03.12.2006
		 * Functional
			 o DONE - Highlight current move in move pane. 
		 * Usability improvements
			 o DONE - WP-PLUGIN: <noscript> for no JS support
			 o DONE - Tooltips for buttons
			 o DONE- Make the move pane configurable
			 		Board takes an optional assoc of options
						+ imagePrefix - the prefix of the image location (defaults to "img/")
						+ showMovesPane - show the moves pane (defaults to false)
			 o Disable non functional buttons [waiting feedback from designer]
			 o Some info about the current move 
		 * Testing
			 o Have to try different PGN files 
		 * Documentation
			 o Source code needs docs
			 o All README.txt's are empty. 

	Serious:
		+ imagePrefix not working - FIXED - update site
		+ When 2 same pieces can make a move but no additional
			information is given about which to move but only
			one of the pieces can be played there because
			otherwise the king would be checked. No such logic
			yet.

	Normal:
		+ Read the PGN spec
			+ think what to do with comments
			+ variations
		+ get new images from Riivo - EMAIL SENT
		+ test the page with IE 6, 7
			+ when i alert the innerHTML of the div I get the contents it should have
				but nothing is displayed :(
			+ mnz, helmer, martti, johh can be testers
	
	Any:
		+ write about starting devel with wordpress
		+ Make development page (wiki) at pgnview.com
