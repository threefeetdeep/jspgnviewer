1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 Bg4 4.Nbd2 Nbd7 5.h3 Bh5 6.c4 c6
7.Bd3 Bxf3 { Black moves his light-square Bishop THRICE within his
  first 7 moves -- too many!  Don't bother with Bh5;
	  instead, just take White's f3 Knight (as you did on
		  move 7, anyway!) Bh5 turned out to be a wasted tempo. }
			8.Nxf3 e6 9.O-O Bd6 10.b3 O-O 11.Bb2 Qc7
			12.Rc1 Rac8 13.c5 Be7
			{ White really bottles Black up with 13.c5!  Should Black
			have played c5 himself before 13.c5 in order to open things
			up for himself and get a little activity for his pieces? }
			14.Qc2 b6 15.b4 bxc5 16.bxc5 Rb8 17.Rb1 a5
			{ a5 seems ill-advised in that Black is moving his a-pawn
			that much closer to White's pieces, making it more accessible
			to White's attack (which White eventually did).  It wasn't as if
			Black's a-pawn was passed! }
			18.Bc3 Ra8 19.Rb2 Rfb8 20.Rxb8+ Rxb8 21.Rb1 Bd8
			22.Rxb8 Qxb8 23.Qa4 Qc7 24.Nd2 h6 25.Nb3 Ne4
			{ Once Black realized that his a-pawn was a goner after 24.Nd2,
			maybe Black ought to have accepted the loss of one pawn and
			tried to keep White's a-pawn from Queening.  Black opens up the
			game with Ne4, giving White's pieces more activity. }

			{
				 Notes:
				 Black played a reasonably decent game against a higher-rated opponent.
				 However, Black's pieces were bottled up and what little piece activity
				 there was was White's.  Also, pushing Black's isolated a-pawn backfired
				 by bringing it that much closer to White's pieces &nbsp; making it more
				 susceptible to attack.

				 Finally, Black admits that he didn't know the first thing about D02, Grunfeld Reversed.
