1. d4 {I had a breif infatuation with this move, but the KID effectively killed it} Ng8f6 2. c4 g6 3. Nb1c3 Bf8g7 4. e4 d6 {ugg the KID} 5. Bf1e2 O-O 6. Bc1g5 {maybe this is book maybe not, I was playing off an idea of karpov's from the english where he tries to force h6 claiming it to be a weakness} h6 
7. Bg5e3 e5 8. d5 a6 9. Qd1d2 Kg8h7 {Ng4, BxN, BxB, f6, Bd7, Bxh6} 10. f3 Nf6h5 11. O-O-O {g4 seems a reasonable alternative here as it prevents black from playing f5 and the Bishop on e3 prevents Qh4+} b5 {While I can't say it's terrible I don't like this gambit because it provides a use for whites light squared bishop which was previously hemmed in by his pawns} 12. cxb5 axb5 
13. Be2xb5 Bc8a6 14. g4 Nh5f4 15. Bb5xa6 {I don't want to drop the a2 pawn} Nb8xa6 16. Be3xf4 exf4 17. Ng1e2 {I decided to complete development instead of taking the pawn. This allows the threat Nxf4 and g5 can be met by Nd4! +- the second point of this is that after BxN, NxN can be played instead of bxc3 when I will have to deal with rooks on the a& b file} Na6c5 
18. Qd2xf4 {Nxf4, Bxc3, Qxc3, Rxa2} Bg7f6 {I don't understand this. Qh4 seems a more effective move connecting the rooks and preventing the h-file from being opened} 19. h4 Bf6xh4 20. Qf4h2 g5 21. Ne2d4 Rf8h8 22. Nd4f5 Kh7g6 
23. Nf5xh4 gxh4 24. Qh2xh4 Qd8g5 25. Qh4xg5 {deciding to simplify to a game two pawns up with a passed a-pawn} hxg5 26. a3 {the desire was to allow the Nc3-b5-d4, but I didn't consider the loss of the f-pawn. Easier was probably Rxh8, Rxh8, Nc5} Nc5b3 27. Kc1c2 Nb3d4 
28. Kc2d3 Nd4xf3 29. Rh1xh8 Ra8xh8 30. Nc3b5 Nf3e5 31. Kd3d4 Rh8h2 
32. Nb5xc7 Rh2xb2 33. Nc7e8 Rb2b6 34. Ne8xd6 Ne5xg4 35. Nd6c4 Rb6a6 
36. d6 Ra6a7 37. Kd4c5 Ng4f6 38. Nc4e5 Kg6g7 39. d7 Nf6xd7 {the rest as they say is matter of technique which at my level is not always there} 40. Rd1xd7 Ra7xa3 
41. Rd7xf7 Kg7h6 42. Kc5d5 Ra3a5 43. Kd5e6 {using the knight as a shield for the king.} Ra5a4 44. Ke6f5 Ra4a6 45. Ne5g4 Kh6h5 
46. Rf7h7 1-0
